Introduction
The Multi-Login System with Email Verification is a web application designed to demonstrate the implementation of user and admin authentication using email verification. It is built with [insert technology stack here, e.g., Node.js, Express, MongoDB]. The project offers a simple and secure way to manage user and admin accounts, making it suitable for educational purposes or as a starting point for building more complex authentication systems.

Features
User Registration: New users can create accounts by providing their email addresses and passwords. Email verification is required before the account becomes active.

Admin Registration: Administrators can sign up through a separate admin registration process, similar to the user registration flow.

Email Verification: When a user or admin registers, an email with a verification link is sent to the provided email address. Clicking on the link verifies the account.

Multi-Login: The system supports both user and admin logins, each with their respective access levels and permissions.

Account Management: Users and administrators can update their account information and reset their passwords through the application.
